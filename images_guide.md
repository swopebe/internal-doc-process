## Diagrams

### When to use diagrams

Diagrams include flow charts, and artwork that use shapes and objects to show relationships and transfer of information.

### Requesting a diagram

1. Submit a request for a diagram at the following link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdF8V0n3E-aAfRen8vZchXCxwA0iDTd0QYyASnutznfGLATvA/viewform.

2. Generally, allow about 4 days for a single diagram. If you submit a few, it will likely take more time.

3. Review the artwork and provide comments. They can also work with an SME, when needed. 

4. When they complete your artwork, the design team will send you a final copy of the diagram in PNG format for you to add to our *images* folder.

The design team will keep the source file so they can use it for any updates.
