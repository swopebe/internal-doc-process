## Template for troubleshooting topics


**Main title as a header 1**

Short description of what the topic addresses

**Symptom as a header 2**: <Example:Application deployment version>

Describe concisely the symptom


**Resolving the problem as a header 3**: Application deployment version

Steps to resolve.

## Reminders

- Support will use this in customer interactions; the clearer, the better.
- Use a new file for a new troubleshooting topic. 
- If there are mulitple resolutions to the same problem, list them in the same file.
- Clean this up as needed every z-stream and GA release. (Use cross-squad Jira/Epic to get old t-shooting removed every quarter.)
- New troubleshooting topics require new GitHub issues.
