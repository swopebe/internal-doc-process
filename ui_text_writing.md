## Prerequisites

Always start with the [IBM Style Guide](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/ccs/ccs_folder/ibm_style_guide/ibm_stylepdf). From the navigation, notice that the style guide covers not only product documentation, but a variety of other topics.

Keep an eye on the _What's new_ section in the guide, as it is regularly updated. 

To build content that references the UI, follow the guidance in the GUI elements topic.

For example, you will see the following guidance for clickable items and icon images:

_For graphical items such as push [clickable] buttons or icons, if users would benefit from seeing the graphic, include it after the label or tooltip name._

_If the graphical item does not have a label or name, provide a generic description._

**Example:** On the toolbar, click the **Permanent Pen** icon [image-here].

Always start with the IBM Style Manual since it helps all teams have one voice. See the following section to see how the product is standardized on top of the IBM standards:

## Guidance for console content

- The user interface is named the **console** (lowercase unless for some strange reason you start your sentence with console).

- While you do not have to document the console, the doc will have console tasks, so it is important for the team to agree on elements outside of the GUI style guide.

- If you have an extensive console, you may want to create and maintain a _Console guide_ in the documentation. This section is a place where you can explain very active pages, such as the _Getting started_ page. Additionally, you may have to document short tasks that only belong to the console, like _Configuring a logo_.

- For windows, modals, pages, etc..., italicize the element. Example: Find your cluster in the _Cluster details_ page. Reserve bold for clickable items.

- Be sure to use _Search_ and _Find_ properly. Many times you are telling the user to find something in a list, but you are telling them to search for something in the _Search box_ or _Search bar_. Be clear when using these two terms.
(This was an issue raised by a Design VP because the two words confused the user.)

- Though the first page the user sees has "welcome" in the URL, it is called the _Getting started_ page. Be sure to stay on top of changes on this page. Also be sure to have the ID team stay on top of links on this page. For instance, the console may have a link to the documentation, but the writer may have removed that file. This has in the past caused broken links on the _Getting started_ page.

- The GUI element **(...)** is currently named _Options_, though the hover help reads: "Click for more options." 

When you decide what to name an element (if it is not named in the IBM Style Manual), you should use the hover-help as a guide. It is important that the ID team name the element the same. 

**Note:** If the UI developers do not have hover-help for a GUI element, always check with them and maybe encourage them to name their element in hover help.

## Selected guidance

|Element|Reason|Guidance|
--------|------------|-------------|
|Bold|Use for UI, clickable components|Use bold for UI buttons and clickable elements. Do not use bold for emphasis, see Style Guide.
|Variable inside of a command or script sample|Identify as a variable.|Use angle brackets (<>) to identify a variable. Surround the variable with the angle brackets (<>) to identify it within the existing monospace style. Ex: `oc get <namespace>`. 
|Variable ouside of a command or script sample (in normal text).|Identify as a variable.|Use monospace style to identify a variable. Surround the variable with backticks to add the monospace style to identify it as a variable. Ex: Replace `namespace` with the name of your project namespace. 
|Menu cascade|Identify it as successive selections in a menu|Use bold for the selections, and separate them by the character >. The > should not be bold. For example: *Multi-cluster* > *Pods*|
|A window or UI page|Identifies a title|Use italic for this content. Example: In the _windowname_ window, select *Save*.
|Quotation marks|Not really used much in docs outside of within codeblocks (citations only and rarely in doc)|Try to avoid
